> In my work with software entrepreneurs, I often get questions about outsourcing software product development. In many cases, these questions come from non-technical, or non-software founders. I call this type of founders "business founders”. (as opposed to technical founders, that come from a technological background). My take: add a technical co-founder or CTO to your team or your startup has a serious handicap.

Most business founders have a pretty good feeling with the market: their ideas sprout from observing real business problems. Business founders are often capable of estimating and testing if there is a market for their proposed software.  What they lack however, is knowledge about how to translate their idea into working software. The most logical thing to do then, as a business founder, is to outsource your software product development to a 3rd party, or isn’t it? Here are six reasons why:

## 1. Estimating Cost and Complexity
In order to assess wether you are pursuing an idea worth solving, you better have a rough understanding of cost and complexity of the software to be developed. Are we talking rocket science or the proverbial “let’s do this in a weekend”? It’s hard for business founders to make this assessment, so you’ll base your go/no-go decision on whatever a 3rd party tells you.

## 2. Technological Choices
Whenever a software developer starts talking tech, business founders are lost: we’ll do this in Rails/Laravel/NodeJs with a blabla database… For business founders, one might as well talk in Chinese. Most business founders worry about this: will this stack scale? Will I later on find people to support these technologies? By outsourcing your development, the 3rd party will make technological choices that you’ll have to live with for a while, without you being able to really make a judgement call. Scary, isn’t it?

## 3. Incremental Development
Modern SaaS companies build their products incrementally: start with a minimal viable product (or sometimes even less), listen to users, add what is absolutely needed, repeat. SaaS has the incredible benefit that all your installed base is on the same version, and that you can seamlessly upgrade and progress. But is your 3rd party as flexible? Can they deliver increment after increment without breaking things, at the speed at which you would like to evolve? Or do you spend precious time negotiating the contract and scope of the next increment? And believe me, you will change your mind often about what features to include and what not.

## 4. Speed
Related to the previous: can your 3rd party follow with all your requests? Chances are that you are not the only customer waiting for a delivery from the 3rd party. It’s not uncommon that software builders oversell their people, at the expense of longer lead times for their customers. Can you afford to go at half speed?

## 5. Operations
A SaaS company is responsible not only for building the software product, but also for operating it. That includes maintaining the infrastructure (think servers, databases, …), making backups, supporting customers, fixing issues. Who will do this? Will the business founders do this, without knowing the actual software itself? Will the 3rd party do this? What response times can you expect when attention is needed?

## 6. Their Business Is Not Your Business
I deliberately kept the most important issue for last.  Nobody understands your business as good as you do. On a daily basis, you live and breath your business. You want to do experiments, change things, add metrics and analytics to track x,y and z, etc, etc. Your 3rd party does not know this, does not understand this, their business is to deliver you working software according to spec, not understand your business. An internal developer (or technical co-founder for that matter) would have gone through all the learning and understanding of your business together with you. Together, you and your technical co-founder would brainstorm to always find a solution that works. You cannot expect your outsourcing partner to have a similar commitment to your business as you.

## Conclusion
So my advice to business founders without a technical person on board is simple, but hard to implement: find yourselves a technical person that is as passionate about your idea as you, bring him/her on board and take it from there. In the mean time, spent your time validating problem and solution with as many external parties as possible, the more evidence there is that you are onto something, the easier it will be to attract that white raven.
