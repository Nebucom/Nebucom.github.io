During our fifth and final workshop you will find this out in the series ‘Focus on your business, leave your IT infrastructure to the cloud’. After international players such as Amazon, Rackspace, IBM and CSC, we are now focusing on domestic contributors. Curious as to how IaaS Belgian providers find solutions? Come to our last IaaS workshop on 11 February and ask the experts yourself!

Two independent Belgian cloud computing experts – *Frederik Dekens (Skyscrapers)* and *Daniel Bartz (ComodIT)* – will tell you about what IaaS has to offer today. They will also provide an overview of the IaaS solutions presented in the previous four sessions, specifically for the Belgian market. It is a perfect opportunity if you cannot attend our workshops and wonder what the best cloud provider is for your objectives!

For this meeting Sirris and Agoria have recruited speakers from leading Belgian cloud service companies such as Combell, People & Technology and Stone Internet. They will take turns unveiling their vision and ideas on powerful cloud infrastructure in 10 minutes’ time. 

Afterwards you will have the opportunity to talk to all these providers and ask them all your questions. For example, which provider should I use as a software developer? As a CIO I need to ensure that our services are in accordance to legislation, which partner offers me the best guarantees? What type of agreement is best and what kind of support should my provider offer?  

On 11 February  Sirris is bringing a host of Belgian cloud specialists to Brussels for the closing of five workshops on IaaS. Various domestic players will provide explanations on IaaS and answer all your questions, including the technical ones.
