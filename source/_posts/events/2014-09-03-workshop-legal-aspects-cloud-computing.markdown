> The legal and regulatory landscape around cloud computing is by no means static. Cloud computing that employs a hybrid, community or public cloud model â€œcreates new dynamics in the relationship between an organization and its information, involving the presence of a third party: the cloud provider. This leads to new challenges in understanding how laws apply to a wide variety of information management scenarios and to the different parties under these various scenarios.

Regardless of which computing model you use, cloud or otherwise, you will need to consider the legal issues, specifically those around any data you might collect, store and process. There will likely be national, European or international laws you will need to consider to ensure you are in legal compliance.

In this 2 day bootcamp on 13 and 28 October, we will go more into detail on :

+ ICT contracts, and more specifically for Software as a Service
