## What about your software offering?
Of course, for them, it was easy, they were SaaS from day one. For most software companies in Belgium, the situation is more complicated: Your current offering is **complex** and requires **tweaking and tuning** for each customer, you face **long sales cycles**, your **software architecture and technology** was never intended to be used across the Internet by multiple customers at once.  All this is preventing you from growing your business through a SaaS model. And while we are at it, all this Cloud/IaaS/PaaS/SaaS stuff is **pretty overwhelming**, isn't it.

## "My Software as a SaaS?" bootcamp
Enter the **"My Software as a SaaS?" bootcamps**: In 3 afternoon sessions, we will bring you up to speed with the whole idea of a SaaS business and identify with you the roadblocks you might encounter on your way to a scalable SaaS offering. We'll also bring you in contact with experienced entrepreneurs that went through this journey before you. After those 3 afternoons, you'll understand how you might benefit from going SaaS.

## Practical details:

**Target Audience:** Decision makers (CEO, Founders, CTO) of software companies that are considering SaaS to grow their business but currently do not have a SaaS offering yet.

**Dates:** April 30th, May 15th (new date!!) and May 20th, 13:00 - 18:00
