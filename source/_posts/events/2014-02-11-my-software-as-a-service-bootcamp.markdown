## Explore the opportunities of SaaS for growing your software business.
Do you know [Davy Kestens](https://twitter.com/davykestens)? He founded his software company [SparkCentral](http://www.sparkcentral.com) (formally known as TwitSpark) in 2011, raised more than 5 million dollars and has 16 people working for him, with customers like Delta Airlines, Brussels Airlines or Volkswagen. Or [Woorank](http://www.woorank.com), the company of [Jean Dereley](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jderely). They are based in Brussels, founded in 2011, 18 people. These are just 2 examples of Belgian software companies that grow and scale fast thanks to SaaS. Software is eating the world, isn't it.

## What about your software offering?
Off course, for them, it was easy, they were SaaS from day one. For most software companies in Belgium, the situation is more complicated: Your current offering is **complex** and requires **tweaking and tuning** for each customer, you face **long sales cycles**, your **software architecture and technology** was never intended to be used across the Internet by multiple customers at once.  All this is preventing you from growing your business through a SaaS model. And while we are at it, all this Cloud/IaaS/PaaS/SaaS stuff is **pretty overwhelming**	, isn't it.

## "My Software as a SaaS?" bootcamp
Enter the **"My Software as a SaaS?" bootcamps**: In 3 afternoon sessions, we will bring you up to speed with the whole idea of a SaaS business and identify with you the roadblocks you might encounter on your way to a scalable SaaS offering. We'll also bring you in contact with experienced entrepreneurs that went through this journey before you. After those 3 afternoons, you'll understand how you might benefit from going SaaS.

## Practical details:

**Target Audience:** Decision makers (CEO, Founders, CTO) of software companies that considering SaaS to grow their business but currently do not have a SaaS offering yet.

**Dates:** April 30th, May 7th and May 20th, 13:00 - 18:00
