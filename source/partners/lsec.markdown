## LSEC - Leaders in Security 
LSEC is a European not-for-profit industry association, based in Belgium.
The community represents more than 130 expert members from the ICT security industry, research and associated partners from around the world. LSEC brings thought leadership on ICT security related matters to market, supporting awareness and the overall market development.
 
LSEC coordinates industrial ict security projects overarching the membership in domains such as cyber security, market research, innovation models, mobile, payment, information sharing, privacy and cloud.
 
In Nebucom, LSEC is contributing to all activities, but is the main contributor to one of the most important topics of SaaSification and one of the major concerns on cloud : Security. LSEC will be contributing insights in the major developments, providing insights and guidance on challenges related to ensuring the security of SaaS for migrating companies. Our aim is to provide guidance on fast evolving models of authentication and access controls, standards under development, certification schemes of cloud service providers, advanced encryption schemes for confidential information, integrity protection, ...

For this, LSEC will rely upon some of its key experts in this domain. Companies such as Zion Security and Vasco Data Security have an established presence and growing interest in the development of their SaaS. Many other companies provide solutions, expertise and technologies to ensure security of providing your Software as a Service.
 
LSEC will also support its community members in building their own SaaS model and moving to the cloud. They are a minority, but similar to many other industries, a number of companies in the ICT security domain have not yet embraced the cloud model, for many similar reasons. The ambition with Nebucom is to support also these companies in Belgium, to innovate towards a SaaS model.
